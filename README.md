## ✅ To-Do App with Local Storage

A **To-Do App** built using **React JS** and **Vite**, designed to manage tasks efficiently with the ability to persist data using **Local Storage**. The app leverages **React Hooks** and **Context API** to manage state across components, providing a seamless and interactive task management experience. This project is ideal for understanding:

- 📝 **Task Management System** – Add, edit, and delete tasks with ease.  
- 💾 **Local Storage Integration** – Persist task data even after refreshing the browser.  
- ⚡️ **State Management** – Utilized `useState` for task handling and `useContext` with **Context API** for global state.  
- 🧩 **Component-Based Structure** – Modular and reusable components for clean and maintainable code.  
- 🚀 **Vite-Powered Build** – Fast build times and hot reloading for a better development experience.  

### 📚 Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **React JS** – Component-based architecture for building interactive and scalable UIs.  
- ⚡️ **Vite** – Lightning-fast development environment and optimized builds.  
- 🔥 **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern syntax with clean and efficient code practices.  
- 🧠 **React Hooks** – Used `useState` for task state, `useEffect` for syncing with Local Storage, and `useContext` for centralized state management.  
- 📡 **Context API** – Managed global state to handle task data efficiently.
